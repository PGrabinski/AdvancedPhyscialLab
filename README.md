# AdvancedPhyscialLab
University Course: Physical Lab 2
Supervision: dr hab. Robert Bryl

### The course
This course consist of 5-6 classics od 20th century physics. Many of the experimental results were rewerded with a Nobel prize. During the course, students perform the same experiments, but with a modern setup. Thanks to these modern acuqisition methods, more data is produced what leads to a better chance for analysis.

### My work
I was graded 5 (max. of 2-5 scale) for the following experiments:
* Electron charge to mass ratio measurement
* Frank-Hertz experiment
* Work function measurment
* Mass spectroscopy
* X-ray crystalography

I was using:
* Mathematica for data analysis
* LaTeX for report preperation
